# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web application system that enables real-time communication between a public user interface and an administrative interface. The system allows users to trigger actions that send messages to administrators without requiring authentication, while providing a separate admin interface for monitoring these messages.

## Glossary

- **User_Interface**: The public-facing web page that allows anonymous users to interact with the system
- **Admin_Interface**: The administrative web page that displays messages from user interactions
- **Message_System**: The backend service that handles real-time message transmission between interfaces
- **Button_Action**: The user interaction that triggers message sending
- **Real_Time_Display**: The immediate presentation of messages on the admin interface without page refresh
- **AWS_Infrastructure**: The cloud deployment environment using AWS CDK for infrastructure as code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anonymous user, I want to press a button on a web page, so that I can send a predefined message to administrators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface SHALL display a clickable button labeled for user interaction
2. WHEN a user clicks the button, THE Message_System SHALL transmit the message "speak german" to the Admin_Interface
3. THE User_Interface SHALL provide immediate feedback confirming the button press was successful
4. THE User_Interface SHALL be accessible without any authentication or login requirements
5. THE Button_Action SHALL complete within 3 seconds of user interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view messages from user interactions in real-time, so that I can monitor user activity without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin_Interface SHALL display received messages immediately upon transmission
2. WHEN a message is received, THE Real_Time_Display SHALL show the message "speak german" without page refresh
3. THE Admin_Interface SHALL maintain a chronological list of all received messages
4. THE Admin_Interface SHALL be accessible without authentication requirements
5. THE Real_Time_Display SHALL update within 2 seconds of message transmission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the application deployed on AWS infrastructure, so that it can be accessed reliably over the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL host both User_Interface and Admin_Interface as web applications
2. THE Message_System SHALL use AWS services for real-time message transmission
3. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL be defined using AWS CDK with TypeScript
4. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL provide public internet access to both interfaces
5. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL support concurrent users accessing both interfaces simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application built with TypeScript, so that the codebase has type safety and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface SHALL be implemented using TypeScript
2. THE Admin_Interface SHALL be implemented using TypeScript  
3. THE Message_System SHALL be implemented using TypeScript
4. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL be defined using TypeScript CDK constructs
5. THE codebase SHALL compile without TypeScript errors before deployment
