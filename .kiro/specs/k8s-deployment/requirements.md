# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enabling Kubernetes deployment of the user-admin-messaging application while maintaining compatibility with existing AWS deployment. The system will support dual deployment modes, allowing the application to run on both AWS Lambda/API Gateway and Kubernetes clusters.

## Glossary

- **User_Admin_Messaging_System**: The existing WebSocket-based messaging application that enables communication between users and administrators
- **K8s_Deployment_System**: The Kubernetes deployment configuration and containerization components
- **Docker_Container**: Containerized version of the application components
- **Deployment_Manager**: The system component responsible for managing deployment configurations
- **WebSocket_Service**: The containerized WebSocket server for Kubernetes deployment
- **Frontend_Service**: The containerized frontend applications (user and admin)
- **Configuration_Manager**: Component that handles environment-specific configurations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the user-admin-messaging application on Kubernetes clusters, so that I can leverage container orchestration and scaling capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide Docker containers for all application components
2. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes, THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL maintain all existing functionality from the AWS deployment
3. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL support horizontal pod autoscaling for the WebSocket service
4. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide Kubernetes manifests for deployment, services, and ingress configuration
5. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL support both development and production Kubernetes environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work seamlessly in both AWS and Kubernetes environments, so that I can choose the appropriate deployment target based on requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL detect the deployment environment automatically
2. WHEN running in Kubernetes, THE WebSocket_Service SHALL use cluster-native service discovery
3. WHEN running in AWS, THE User_Admin_Messaging_System SHALL continue using existing Lambda and API Gateway configurations
4. THE Frontend_Service SHALL adapt its backend endpoints based on the deployment environment
5. THE Deployment_Manager SHALL provide environment-specific configuration without code changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to containerize the application components, so that they can run consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docker_Container SHALL package the WebSocket server with all required dependencies
2. THE Docker_Container SHALL package the frontend applications as static file servers
3. WHEN building containers, THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL optimize for production deployment
4. THE Docker_Container SHALL support configurable environment variables for different deployments
5. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide multi-stage Docker builds for efficient image sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive Kubernetes deployment configurations, so that I can deploy and manage the application effectively in a cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide Kubernetes Deployment manifests for all services
2. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide Service manifests for internal and external communication
3. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide Ingress configuration for external access
4. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide ConfigMap and Secret management for configuration
5. WHERE horizontal scaling is needed, THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide HorizontalPodAutoscaler configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build and deployment scripts for Kubernetes, so that I can easily build, test, and deploy the containerized application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide scripts to build all Docker images
2. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide scripts to deploy to Kubernetes clusters
3. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide scripts to validate Kubernetes deployments
4. WHEN building for different environments, THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL support environment-specific configurations
5. THE K8s_Deployment_System SHALL provide cleanup scripts for removing deployments
